# eBay-kleinanzeige-Car-Sales-Data
In this guided project, we'll work with a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section of the German eBay website.  The dataset was originally scraped and uploaded to Kaggle. We've made a few modifications from the original dataset that was uploaded to Kaggle:  We sampled 50,000 data points from the full dataset, to ensure your code runs quickly in our hosted environment We dirtied the dataset a bit to more closely resemble what you would expect from a scraped dataset (the version uploaded to Kaggle was cleaned to be easier to work with)
